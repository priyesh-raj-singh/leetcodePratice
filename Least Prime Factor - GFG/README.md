# Least Prime Factor
## Easy 
<div class="problem-statement">
                <p></p><p><span style="font-size:18px">Given a number N, find&nbsp;least prime factors for all numbers from 1 to N.&nbsp; The least prime factor of an integer N is the smallest prime number that divides it.<br>
<strong>Note :&nbsp;</strong>The least prime factor of all even numbers is 2. A prime number is its own least prime factor (as well as its own greatest prime factor).1 needs to be printed for 1.â€‹</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example 1:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input</strong>: N = 6
<strong>Output:</strong>&nbsp;[1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2]&nbsp;
<strong>Explanation</strong>: least prime factor of 1 = 1,
least prime factor of 2 = 2,
least prime factor of 3 = 3,
least prime factor of 4 = 2,
least prime factor of 5 = 5,
least prime factor of 6 = 2.
So answer is[1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2]. </span>
</pre>

<span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example 2:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input: </strong>N = 4
<strong>Output:&nbsp;</strong>[1, 2, 3, 2]
<strong>Explanation</strong>: least prime factor of 1 = 1,
least prime factor of 2 = 2,
least prime factor of 3 = 3,
least prime factor of 4 = 2.
So answer is[1, 2, 3, 2].

<span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Your Task:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br>
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function <strong>leastPrimeFactor()&nbsp;</strong>which takes N&nbsp;as input parameter and returns&nbsp;a list of integers containing all the least prime factor&nbsp;of each numbers&nbsp;from 1 to N.</span><br>
